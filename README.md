This is a web app created with basic knowledges of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to have fun with your smartphone. The project is realized during the *Boolean Coding Week 2022*, organized by [Boolean](https://boolean.careers/).

It uses the **Web Speech API**, in particular the _SpeechSynthesisUtterance_ interface of the Web Speech API, which represents a speech request and contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume). In this application only the pitch is regulated.
